<h1>Using</h1>

“Ok, so how do i actually get an application/website to use this font”

unfortunately there isn't a simple answer to that.
Most things will either use whatever the default emoji font is, or they'll have a list of fonts that they check for.

font names:
note: i will talk about the "name" of a font. this is determined by metadata in the font, not by the filename. (i.e. renaming the file won't do anything, you have to use a tool to change the strings in the <code>name</code> table)

<h2>Firefox Default Font</h2>
Affects: the firefox ui, and websites which don't specify an emoji font
<p>In <a href=about:config>about:config</a>, change <code>font.name-list.emoji</code> to “Twemoji COLR”.

<h2>Windows 10/11 Default Font</h2>
Affects: applications which use the default font, and websites which have "Segoe UI Emoji" in their emoji font list
<p>The default emoji font is named "Segoe UI Emoji". You may be able to override it by installing twemoji as this name, but it could cause problems.(applications may expect the emoji font to have certain features)

<h2>MacOS Default Font</h2>
<p>Similar to windows, but with "Apple Color Emoji"
	
<h2>Websites</h2>
<p>
	
<p>many websites will specify a list of emoji fonts, and will use the first one you have installed.
	this list almost always begins with "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji". so, installing twemoji with the name "Apple Color Emoji" is a fairly reliable option (unless you are on MacOS) This works on websites such as Bluesky, 


For example, most websites will use a list of emoji fonts like:
"Apple Color Emoji"
"Segoe UI Emoji" (microsoft's emoji font)
"Noto Color Emoji" (google's emoji font)
